"""
Given a sorted list with an unsorted number V in the rightmost cell, can you write some simple code to insert V into the array so that it remains sorted? Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is fully sorted.

Guideline: You can copy the value of V to a variable and consider its cell "empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift everything over until V can be inserted.
